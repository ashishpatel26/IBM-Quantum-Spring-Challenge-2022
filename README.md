# IBM-Quantum-Spring-Challenge-2022
The IBM Quantum Spring Challenge 2022 will be divided into two segments. One part will invite participants to tackle problems revolving around many-body systems, while the other will focus on fermionic chemistry simulations. Participants will get a one-of-a-kind opportunity to investigate problems at the forefront of quantum computing research.  Each exercise is presented as a Jupyter notebook which is hosted on the IBM Quantum Lab. Complete all parts in each to complete the exercise.  To recognize your achievement, those who complete all the exercises will receive a digital achievement badge to showcase the skills you've developed throughout the challenge.
